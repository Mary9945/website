    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>This is a website of my photography and my Nomadic Sewing Creations . As an archaeologist and  photographer, I have the opportunity to travel and work in the Nlakapmux territory, part of my job as an archaeologist was to photograph not only wild flowers, plants, trees, animals, and land scaped/scenereies. Besides taking pictures for my job, i also enjoy taking family portraits, weddings, and photos of water, clouds. My other thing i enjoy is sewing. I make ribbon skirts, dresses and ribbon shirts of various sizes, traditional, fancy and jingle dress regalia.</p>
